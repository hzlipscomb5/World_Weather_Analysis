# World_Weather_Analysis
Analyzing data for a Travel Website using APIS

## Summary
For this module we used OpenWeather API, as well as Google Maps API's to create functionality for a vacation plan app. We used a random generator to produce longitudes and latitudes to prepare a list of cities for our use. We set an input function to choose temperature requirements and filtered the selections based on this. We also used Google's API to find the closest hotel to all of our chosen cities. Once we had the weather and hotel information for each city, we created a map with markers that held the information we gathered. We also made a travel route based on the locations of the cities, via Google's directions API.
